# LAB 13

## busMall
In this project we ask the user to choose his favorite products out of 20 products by asking him to pick one out of three each time for 25 times. I added  a chart to display the results data. In lab 13 I added a local storage to store the data so ever next time a user use the website the data will be updated.
